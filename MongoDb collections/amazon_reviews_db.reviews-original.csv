I like that it‚Äôs very compact and lightweight the down jacket. I happen to love the yellow colour on this jacket, it‚Äôs very robust. But it‚Äôs not for everybody. This is a good jacket for fall, autumn, maybe early winter, but this won‚Äôt keep you warm when it‚Äôs very cold like in the minus. The jacket is very light and is not meant for extreme cold temperatures. The zipper seems okay a little flimsy at times. I bought the jacket on sale so the value for the money was decent. It seems to do well when it gets wet a bit, but I don‚Äôt know how well it would do with sever raining or with thunderstorms. It seems to be a little waterproof to a certain point.

I took it for a light hike in 8C weather and when it got too hot, I just stowed it away in the included pouch which doesn't take up much space at all - very handy!  However, I don't know how long this jacket will last as the down has been shedding every since I got it. It leaves loose down on whatever you're wearing underneath. After a few hours, it looks like a spend some time playing with a cat. I only paid $38 for it though... at regular price I would not recommend it.

67f81434a76c069806723599,Lavender Honey,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The Amazon Fire TV Stick HD is, overall, a solid streaming device with some great features, but it doesn‚Äôt come without its frustrations. The positives: The user interface is highly intuitive and very responsive -- exactly what you‚Äôd expect from an Amazon product. Navigating through menus is smooth, and the layout is simple and easy to follow, which makes using the device a breeze. Setting it up was incredibly easy as well. I was up and running in just a few minutes, with minimal hassle. Alexa integration is another plus, allowing for voice controls that make the overall experience more efficient. However, there are some minor gripes.  One of the biggest selling points is access to ""free"" video content, which initially sounds fantastic -- who doesn't want more free stuff?  However, the reality is a bit underwhelming. Most of the content under the free tab either isn't that appealing, or you still have to pay to unlock episodes. Youtube is included as part of the ""free"" but tbh, YouTube is available on almost every TV stick out there. It doesn‚Äôt really add anything special to the device. Another slight inconvenience is the frequent need to install third-party apps to access content. You think you've found something to watch, but instead, you're prompted to download and install yet another app before you can actually start streaming. It really breaks one out of s the experience of seamless browsing and watching, which is what you'd expect from a device like this. It would be much better if the content was directly available without all these additional steps. The ""free"" tab is more geared toward pushing paid content on me than giving me actual free stuff. Every time I browse it, I‚Äôm met with more upsells than real free viewing options. At the end of the day, this is still a decent streaming device, especially for those who already have Prime or are deeply integrated into Amazon's ecosystem. But if you're getting it with the expectation of a treasure trove of free content, you‚Äôre going to be disappointed. I would like Amazon to improve the quality and availability of truly free content. If they can address that, the Fire TV Stick would be an even stronger contender in the streaming world.

67f81443a76c06980672359c,Slivy58,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Already own a sub 250 gram drone with a 4K camera and 3-axis gimble so... Did extensive research prior to purchasing the DJI Neo by reading/watching lots of reviews. After a few days toying with it, I am 110% sold. Nope by no means is it perfect yet IMHO, the positive far outweigh the negatives. Build quality is first rate in my opinion so should stand up fairly well. Props are well protected, battery latches firmly into place, has a camera guard/cover, power and mode control buttons are top mounted, has voice prompts, available in a ""Fly More Combo"" kit, etc. Super small footprint yet packs a punch. Multifunction in that it can be flown w/o a phone or RC controller, with a mobile phone, and/or with the DJI RC-N3 remote controller. Has palm takeoff and landing, voice control, AI subject tracking and quickshots, etc. Compared to other drones equipped with a single axis gimble, DJI stabilization technology really does a great job in keeping the footage smooth. I've gotten between 11-13 minutes of battery runtime so we are OK with that. My only real complaint(s) would have to be the limited onboard (non-removable/upgradable) storage. Although 22GB seems fairly ample so far it is an odd choice for such a device... To download footage requires plugging the drone into a device, no battery/power-on needed.

67f8145ca76c0698067235a1,Gloria Huen,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Here's my take on this monitor after a few weeks of use. Pros: Cost-Effective: As price was a major factor for me, this monitor met my needs perfectly. It's affordable without sacrificing the quality Samsung is known for. Reliable Brand: Opting for Samsung was an easy choice due to their reputation for reliability. This monitor has lived up to that expectation, operating smoothly since setup. Ideal Port Orientation: Unlike many other brands, the connection ports on this Samsung monitor are oriented downwards. This design choice minimizes stress on the connectors, potentially enhancing their longevity‚Äîa subtle yet appreciated feature. Cons: Insufficient Contrast: The monitor falls short in the contrast department. For instance, when I‚Äôm on the Gmail page, it's difficult to distinguish between read and unread emails due to the lack of contrast. This can be a significant drawback for those who rely on visual cues for efficiency. Read more","Reviewed in Canada on May 13, 2024",https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08J4JRRCT?th=1

A battery charger and instructions. It can follow you. Do a bunch of quickshots. It has pretty good tracking. The video is a bit misleading showing it fly over water though. Flying over water is not advised . Or in low light. or over puddles. The drone seems to do best on a sunny day. You can use the drone on its own. You can use it with a phone or you can use it with the remote. Quality needs some fine tuning and is not the best. Video is alright but could be better. Pictures are not very good quality at all. The drone is super fun to fly though. Even has the ability to use the goggles and fpv remotes. Range is great with the remote. I like it but it really needs a update for flying in low light. Would love to try the fpv. Maybe soon. I can recommend it for beginners and kids. Even for pro's who need a solid little drone for travel.

67f814bba76c0698067235b4,Allio,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This little drone is impressive. It‚Äôs so light, but very nimble, and quite fast as well There are so many ways to fly it, wether it‚Äôs just from the palm of your hand (don‚Äôt forget you will need to activate it first), or with your cellphone (it has a virtual joystick), or with the controller RCN2 or RCN3, or RC2, or with the motion controller, or with the fpv controller 3‚Ä¶ even in manual mode with the goggles 3! It can handle winds surprisingly well, and the footage will come out surprisingly good considering. It seems like it was designed to be a selfie drone, but it can do a lot more, even in 4K 30fps or 1080 60fps No D-log or anything like that here, bu If you have a controller, you will be able to make the video a lot better by lowering the sharpness to the minimum. Small hiccup during activation, if you try to do it with an iPad, or a cellphone on wifi, it needs to be connected to the drone‚Äôs wifi network, thus disconnecting you from the internet. You need a cellphone with a cellular network and the drone‚Äôs network at the same time to get through activation. No obstacle avoidance, but it follows your path very precisely and you can have it avoid trees even in a small forest trail.

67f814dea76c0698067235bb,Matthew L.,1.0 out of 5 stars,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this monitor for my wife‚Äôs home office and it came with no screws to mount to the stand. When contacting Samsung about the missing parts they first told me that it IS covered under the warranty and that they‚Äôll send the two little screws free of charge. 2 days later however, they sent a random email with a different resolution, that I never agreed to. When I contacted the customer service they said that I had to pay for these 2 little screws, because I didn‚Äôt report the missing parts within 48 hours of delivery. However, we never had the opportunity to open the package for a few days because we were out of town. As much as I tried to fight this and escalate this, Samsung refuses to acknowledge their error in this and is putting the blame on us for not noticing the missing parts within their policy time, which is extremely egregious and does not give the customer enough time to notice such things (especially in our case). It is extremely disappointing as this is not the first time Samsung Customer Support has let me down like this. They‚Äôve previously made me give back a free gift because they sent me the wrong colour phone and in order to get the correct colour that I ordered, I had to return the free gift. I can‚Äôt believe a company of this size treats their customers so poorly. We are now stuck with a wobbly monitor that could tip over at any given moment, because this billion dollar company won‚Äôt waive a $3 fee to send us parts that should‚Äôve been provided to us in the first place. Disgusting. Read more","Reviewed in Canada on October 16, 2024",https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08J4JRRCT?th=1

67f8150ba76c0698067235c4,Dana,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth Every Penny and Then Some ‚Äì Absolutely Incredible!,"The media could not be loaded.\n                 I have one question‚Äîhow on earth is this thing less than four hundred dollars?! This is one of the best purchases I‚Äôve ever made on a drone. It‚Äôs perfectly steady, and the camera is stunning. The quality of the footage is so clear and crisp, it‚Äôs almost unbelievable. And the range? It can go so far away that I can‚Äôt even fathom the distance. After receiving a terrible drone order that was a complete waste of money, I truly understood just how incredible the DJI Mini 2 SE is. It felt necessary to leave this review despite the fact that not many people might see it because the difference is night and day. This drone is leagues above anything else I‚Äôve tried. Despite a few crashes, this drone works flawlessly and feels like it should be worth at least $1,500. The return-to-home feature is incredibly precise‚Äîliterally down to the inch‚Äîand the motion sensors are spot-on as well. It's also ridiculously easy to fly, which is perfect for anyone, whether you're a beginner or an experienced pilot. The best part? You don‚Äôt even need to register it because it‚Äôs so lightweight. Plus, it‚Äôs super easy to bring into other countries. I packed this drone into a suitcase full of heavy shoes and other items for a trip from Virginia to Turkey. The suitcase was handled roughly, and the boxes inside were damaged‚Äîincluding the drone's box‚Äîbut when I unpacked everything, the drone was completely unscathed. The build quality is just that good! Here‚Äôs something insane to think about: imagine there‚Äôs an island on the Chesapeake Bay you want to fly over. It‚Äôs 7 km away, and this drone has a 10 km range without any signal extenders. But here‚Äôs the catch‚Äîyour drone isn‚Äôt fully charged. You figure it‚Äôs fine and put the drone in sport mode to help it get there faster. But you completely underestimate how long the charge will last (which, by the way, is super long with this amazing piece of tech). When you‚Äôre 4 km out, the drone warns you that it doesn‚Äôt have enough charge to go much further and return safely. If you don‚Äôt listen, it‚Äôll automatically turn back on its own. It‚Äôs like this drone is designed to be unbreakable and impossible to lose! Oh, and did I mention it can even handle CRAZY winds? This thing is a total beast. Last thing: I recommend buying an extra 2 chargers and charging station. Instead of getting 31 mins of flight time, you can get 1.5 hours of it with three batteries. It makes a big difference. Long story short, if you‚Äôre on the fence, don‚Äôt be. Just buy it‚Äîyou won‚Äôt regret it. Read more","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024",https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07FTPX71F?th=1

67f81515a76c0698067235c6,Paul Toumey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good big, comfortable, stylish bag. But be wary about overfilling","I needed a big large bag to hold my Magic the Gathering collection of binders and decks.  This bag satisfied my needs and I am overall very happy with it and would recommend to others for any storage/travel needs. This bag is very large and comfortable. It offers lots of storage space with some neat and fun features as well. It comes in good colors and I love the leather bottom, very similar to Jansport backpacks. All that said, the items that I keep in this bag are very heavy.  This is a bit hard to explain, but when I wear it I feel so much tension/pulling on the stitching where the shoulder straps meet the top of the backpack, I worry that some time sooner than later, the stitching there will fail. At this moment, that is just speculation.  If that ever happens I will come back to this review and update with when I bought it and when it broke. In the meantime, I would recommend this back to most anyone. Just keep in mind though how much you're putting in the bag, it is very large and you could be overfilling before you know it.

67f8151aa76c0698067235c7,Bill P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for casual video and general use,"I mainly use my 13"" MacBook Pro for music production, programming, and then some general web browsing, writing, and real casual general computer work. I'm not a gamer so I don't need 120Hz refresh rates. All I needed was something that would be easy on my eyes, look good in my space, and have a nice crisp display. This monitor is simple to set up. It's got 3 screws. You can move it side to side but there's only 20 degrees of vertical movement. That's fine if you want to look at your monitor head-on or angled slightly up at you but if you need something that tilts downward you'll have to get a VESA mount that either clamps to your desk or mounts to your wall. 22 inches is plenty big with an HD screen and just what I needed when in a dual or triple monitor situation (occasionally I use my work-provided monitor in a 3 monitor setup). For music production it doesn't strain your eyes to be staring at it for hours on end. Same when you're programming. Any monitor will give you eye strain eventually but this one is not going to give most people any issues most of the time. You have  options for HDMI or VGA connections. In my case I had to use a VGA cable for my work monitor in the past so I got an adapter for my laptop for USB-C to VGA connections. This works fine and the quality is the same as HDMI with this particular monitor because VGA quality goes up to around a thousand more pixels than 1080p and supports a refresh rate of 85Hz (assuming you didn't get a cheap cable). This monitor has a 75Hz refresh rate so using a VGA connection is not going to reduce quality. In fact I suspect that they chose HDMI and VGA precisely because the monitor works within the VGA spec and HDMI is just a very common connector these days so they included both while excluding DisplayPort because that's mainly used for higher spec machines and people shopping for a budget monitor likely wouldn't have a DisplayPort compatible computer. Plus DP is not super common anyway outside of offices and expensive computers and has little practical benefits over HDMI to the average person right now. But don't let the fact that this is a budget monitor fool you. If you know you need higher refresh rates because you'll be watching movies and gaming then sure, this isn't for you. If you know you're going to be doing work, browsing the web, watching YouTube videos, coding, doing regular boring average computer stuff, then this is going to be more than enough for you. This is the monitor that should be the default standard for everyone looking for an external laptop monitor or that would come with any PC bundle. I wouldn't want lower quality and most wouldn't even notice higher specs if it had them. It's in the perfect spot. If you need an excellent monitor that isn't a thousand dollar  gaming monitor that's basically a flat screen TV made for the Super Bowl then this will be as good as any other.

Toen dacht ik van laat ik eerst eens kijken of deze hobby wat voor mij is door deze budget drone te kopen. Het is een hele leuke kennismaking gebleken. Wat ik niet meer doe is amazons keuze volgen want achteraf had ik liever het combinatiepakket gekocht met extra batterijen met tas + lader en alle extra's die bij het Combo more pakket inbegrepen zijn. Nu moet ik al deze artikelen los bijkopen en dan ben je zoveel duurder uit dat je gelijk wel een duurder model drone had kunnen kopen. Ik snap Amazon wel dat er zo meer te verdienen valt met deze handreiking naar de verkoper. Deze les kost mij veel extra geld omdat ik alles nu los moet aanschaffen. Uiteraard koop ik deze extra's niet bij Amazon maar bij een webshop eindigend met Express. Mijn aanbeveling voor andere verkopers ga altijd voor het Combo pakket of koop gelijk een duurdere drone.
